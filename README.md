## Plenty of Cats application

'Plenty of Cats' is like Tinder, but for cats. The idea behind this app is that users can create a profile for their kitties so they can meet other cats to play or hang out with.

In this app, users can register for an account if they don't have one and login if they do. Once they've logged in, users can create a profile for their cats with the following information: name, age, breed and bio.

After creating their account, users are able to update it or delete it if they please. Users are also able to 'purr'(or like) other cats' profiles. They can see their likes on the 'Purr' section.

Users can also change their passwords and sign out.

## Planning process and problem-solving strategy

My planning process was first thinking about what app I wanted to built. I talked about some ideas I had with my husband and we both ended up cracking up at the idea of a 'Tinder for Cats', so I went ahead with it. 

The first day of Project Week, I created my wireframes, user stories and ERD. I also created a Suggested Schedule for myself that I referenced every day as I worked on new features.

In regards to my problem-solving strategy, I used a rubber duck to explain to it what I was trying to build. I also used it to debug whenever I ran into issues.

## Problems to be solved in future iterations

In future iterations, users will be able to:

1. Upload their own pictures when they're creating a profile and see it displayed on the Bootstrap Card.
2. 'Match' with other users when they both 'like' each other. 
3. Chat with their matches (using Socket)
